This game can be played by 2 or 3 players. 

The goal of the game is to bike 100 km in total. This can be done by playing:
* Eight 5km cards.
* Four an 6km cards.
* Two 8km cards (these cards can only be played with tailwind activated).
* Two 10km cards  (these cards can only be played with tailwind activated).

If a player bikes 100km, they win the game.
Each round, a player either plays or discards one card from their hand and draws one card from the game stack. During their turn a player can choose to propel themselves forward by playing a kilometer, or make life difficult for their fellow players by playing one of the bully cards. 

Cards in the game: 
Get On (your bike) card (Step Up) - this card needs to be played before playing any of the kilometer cards (You cannot bike if you are not physically on your bike, right?) 

Bully cards: 
* Flat tire card - gets the player off their bike and requires the tire to be fixed, before starting to bike again.
* Closses Criss-cross - gets the player off their bike and requires the criss-cross barrier to be opened, before starting to bike again.
* Hostel, tavern - gets the player off their bike.
* Cross-wind - removes player's tailwind activation (player can no longer bike 8 or 10 km).

* Barrier open card - played to open the closed criss-cross barrier. To continue biking after repairing their bike, a player must first Get-On the bike again.
